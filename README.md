# RBGenie
I'm working to build a Fantasy Football WebApp that analyzes historical statistical data of NFL running backs to build a model of the ideal RB1 and RB2. Then, I'll use that model to predict in percentages how close a running back is to meeting that model (i.e. "Matt Forte is an 86% match to the ideal RB1 model", for example).
